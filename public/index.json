From a system design lens, it\u0026rsquo;s organized by functionality. Here is a breakdown of the departments that make sure the school is meeting its mission on a daily basis:\nTeaching \u0026amp; Academics # Divisional Staff Teachers Grade Level Teachers Content Area Specialist Teachers Substitutes Assistants Academic Support Athletic Coaches Librarians Leadership Head of School Associate Head of School Division Heads Associate Division Heads Head Chaplain Educational Technology Board of Directors Special Programs/Departments Outdoor Education Community Service Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Community Programming Summer School Summer Campus After School Programs Social Emotional Wellness Counselors Social-emotional learning coordinators Non-Teaching Staff # Administrative Staff Divisional administrators Human Resources Business department Accounts Payable Accounts Receivable Comptroller Curriculum Academic Officers Deans Facilities Maintenance team (includes repairs, updates, and grounds) Cleaning and snack delivery Facilities administration Externally-Focused Facing Divisions Advancement Admissions Communications Alumni Relations Other Information Technology (IT) Campus Safety School Store SAGE (contracted dining services) The Learning Community Students Caregivers External systems that impact our internal system: the National Association of Independent Schools, the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest, and the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas to name some.\nThe mission of my school is \u0026ldquo;igniting a life of purpose through the development of an educated conscience.\u0026rdquo; The systems above all work to accomplish this goal. Inputs into our educational system include the work done by advancement (who work towards growing our endowment and raising funds for large projects), admissions (who work to ensure the school has students who are most likely to thrive in our environment - this provides both the students for the system as well as capital in the form of tuition), and the school store also generates capital, but that is used to support students receiving financial assistance.\nThe business office ensures that the capital that comes in and goes out is properly allocated, used, and tracks the financial health of the school overall. HR is responsible for ensuring that the entirety of our staffing is mission-aligned, purposeful, and are properly supported through compensation, benefits, and professional development.\nCommunications plays an interesting, vital role. They not only provide vital communication inside of the school, but both inward and outward facing portals, our website, digital and print publications (aside from student publications), and our social media presence. They not only promote what is going on internally to share our daily lives with our community, but the externally-facing communications tools (social media and websites, for example) also serve to support the admissions department in finding and recruiting learners for our community.\nThe leadership teams ensures that the projects, programs, and curriculum that drive the school meet the needs of students emerging now, but also that the school will thrive and continue to meet its mission for decades to come. Executive leadership (head of school, assistant head of school, division heads, head chaplain) also serve as the representative of the school to external stakeholders and the school board of directors. The heads of the divisions each ensure that their division is working towards the goals created by the head of school (that the school board approves). The curriculum is reviewed and modified by the chief academic officers and, either a division head or the deans. The educational technology team The head chaplain and division chaplains have a special responsibility to the second half of the mission statement: creating an educated conscience. This work is supported by our community service coordinator who ensures students realize their gifts need to be shared with others, both near and far.\nThe day to day work of ensuring the delivery of the mission is done by the divisional staff (classroom teachers, assistants, academic support, athletic coaches, and librarians) as well as SAGE dining services, campus safety, facilities, IT, and the social-emotional wellness team. Divisional staff provide the direct instruction we think of when we think \u0026ldquo;school.\u0026rdquo;\nFacilities ensures that our environment is safe, inviting, clean, and delivers the snacks our students enjoy each day. IT ensures that the infrastructure that allows us to connect to the digital world around us (and print!) is supporting our daily work. The social-emotional wellness team works to incorporate social-emotional wellness and growth into the classroom environment, but also support students on an individual basis in order to ensure they feel loved, welcome, seen, and supported at times when they need additional support to feel emotionally ready to learn. Campus safety ensures the physical safety of our entire community by checking that people entering campus have a reason to be there, and are not a threat to our community, as well as providing safety practices to keep our physical bodies safe from environmental harms. SAGE meets the nutritional needs so the whole school has their human need for food met to continue the hard work of education on a daily basis.\nThe learning community are who we are here to impact. The caregivers provide the extended learning environment to ensure learning outside of the physical building can continue, and deliver the students to the school each day. Students participate in the learning by being actively engaged, attending class, and exploring their interests and passions and they move through the student experience.\n**** ","date":"3 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1717529880982-educational-systems/","section":"Posts","summary":"I currently work in a Pre-K age 3 through 12th grade private school.","title":"Pre-K3 - 12th Private School Educational System Design","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/systems-design/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Systems Design","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"3 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"21 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo","type":"tags"},{"content":"Once again, let\u0026rsquo;s start with some definitions. The Columbia Encyclopedia (2018) states that social sciences study human behavior and relationships utilizing methods that have their basis in the scientific method and, moving through the 20th century, increasingly utilizing quantitative methodologies.\nThe noun \u0026ldquo;science\u0026rdquo; has several layers of definitions that can be addressed. From the Oxford Dictionary of English (2010):\nnoun # [mass noun] the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment: the world of science and technology.\n- a particular area of science: veterinary science [count noun] : the agricultural sciences.\n- a systematically organized body of knowledge on a particular subject: the science of criminology.\n- archaic knowledge of any kind: his rare science and his practical skill.\nThe examples given in the first example fall under the idea of the type of science you might learn in school. Think: biology, chemistry, and physics. I am including agriculture under biology as it’s the applied biological science of plants and animals. Ever wonder why general plant books are in the 570s but your gardening books are in the 630s at your local library (that still utilizes the Dewey Decimal Classification)? This is why! I have been posed the question is there such thing as a social \u0026ldquo;science?\u0026rdquo; Like so many research studies, the answer is \u0026ldquo;it depends.\u0026rdquo;\nIf we are talking about the hard sciences, uncovering the fundamental truths of nature as best they can through rigorous study and evaluation towards a universal understanding of the world, universe, and how everything is made? No. We are not a science. There is no fundamental understanding of the human condition, of human nature that we can uncover.\nIf, instead, you mean the second definition put forward by Oxford Dictionary of English, that we are \u0026ldquo;a systematically organized body of knowledge on a particular subject\u0026rdquo; then yes. We have created special boxes to organize our knowledge into, making smaller boxes as we see fit to organize our ideas and ideas into. As humans, we want answers. We want to understand, we want to make sense of our world. We find new ways to try to investigate and explain things. The issue with social science in the level 1 definition of the word, is that humans are beautifully imprecise, and that means the things we do are also beautifully imprecise. Education has been searching for that answer to how we can best educate a population. All our research, all of our attempts to quantify learning, to find the numbers that explain students, and what have we surmised? We must personalize learning.\nBecause we\u0026rsquo;re human, and while you can always teach the middle, nobody exists there. Every person is wonderful, and exceptional. There is no algorithm to summarize; no algorithm to perfectly explain them. And so, I think it\u0026rsquo;s the art of applied social studies, rather than social science.\nCitations\nOCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (2003).

I have also looked them up more than once, even within the resources that I cited above. I always like to confirm I know their meaning. Each one of those rolls off the tongue so beautifully (especially phenomenology) and I want to do the concepts those words represent justice.\nThere are two main questions being posed this week: one asking about the theories \u0026amp; philosophies covered so far, and one regarding if I feel more immersed in the style of thinking a Ph.D. is required to do.\nTheory \u0026amp; Philosophy # I love all the theories and philosophy. As I have mentioned previously (if you\u0026rsquo;ve read previously), I did Lincoln-Douglas debate in high school. This gave me a solid foundation in the basics of philosophy and helped hone my argumentation. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re not great, the experience you gain in developing arguments on your feet comes in useful in life, and especially in a Ph.D. program.\nOn Ph.D. Thinking and Writing # This part is harder. There\u0026rsquo;s not been a shift in my thinking. This is in line with my Educational Specialist degree, although earlier and more in depth. I\u0026rsquo;m mostly enjoying the conversations, although sometimes the timing means I\u0026rsquo;m less enthusiastic than I might be if it were earlier in the day.\nExcept\u0026hellip; earlier in the day I\u0026rsquo;m talking to 8 year olds. It\u0026rsquo;s whiplash at it\u0026rsquo;s finest.\nThe bigger struggle I\u0026rsquo;m having is finding the joy in the writing process. I enjoy researching, I enjoy reading and learning, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge. Right now, though, academic writing feels like 21st grade MadLibs. When writing analysis articles, I can handle the actual consideration and conclusion-drawing. It\u0026rsquo;s the hair-splitting linguistics where it stops feeling like natural writing and turns into parsing things so finely that true meaning is lost (and readability goes with it, honestly).\nThe shift I\u0026rsquo;ve had towards scholarly writing is \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m less excited about it. I want to do meaningful work, and I want to share it, but I want to share it in a way that is more accessible to people than scholarly writing tends to be. If we\u0026rsquo;re writing in a way where the important parts are a 150-word abstract, 250-word introduction, and conclusions\u0026hellip;. why are we writing 5000 words?\nI like this blog a lot, though.

It allows us to develop communities of practice with our hobbies, no matter how niche, with people on the other side of the planet. We have access to a wealth of knowledge virtually at our fingertips. (Weinstein, et al, 2023, p 7)\nBut this happens at a price. We can connect with people on the other side of the world, but sometimes at the cost of connecting with those closest to us. We can lose ourselves in our narrow interests and filter bubbles and miss a wider perspective on things. We have access to virtually all the knowledge but need the skills to navigate not only the volumes of knowledge but to recognize the dangers of information overload as well as mis- and disinformation.\nWe - as in everybody who uses the internet - must be mindful of the perils of distributed cognition. As the power of our smartphones have grown, so has our regular use - possibly even dependence - on them for basic navigation and information seeking leaving us vulnerable to\nOur Role as Educators # As educators, it is our responsibility to model ethical use of information, critical thinking, and always keep the student at the center of our digital decision-making in the classroom.\nWhen you Google something, ask your students why you chose your keywords, and which responses got your attention the fastest. Point out the ads.\nWhen you use generative AI, discuss why it was the tool to use.\nWhen it\u0026rsquo;s time for a tech break, talk about the mindfulness of using technology.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re picking out a new digital tool to use with your students, ask yourself: Is it better for them, or just me?

I was coached to not point at screens, to always let the student drive (control the computer), and to encourage active engagement versus furious notetaking on the part of the learner. My job was to know how to coach the learner through the process of exploring tools, guide the learner through discovering how menus were organized, and generally help the learner gain the confidence needed to know that clicking the thing would not destroy their new computer.\nThese learners, primarily older than 50, were guided through experiential discovery learning, given scaffolding to guide them from where they were starting to their self-selected learning goals, and joined a community of practice at Apple.\nAfter this, I transitioned into formal education. I brought this teacher-as-coach mentality with me and relished my adolescent psychology class that dove into how the brain makes memories and connections between neurons.\nAs an educator, I learned the science of how our students\u0026rsquo; brains develop and work. The changes that experience - all experiences - have on their physical brain change our brains. I have always been and was excited to learn that neuroscience has highlighted the physical reasons that activating prior knowledge before introducing new material works and that you see Vygotsky\u0026rsquo;s Zone of Proximal Development at play in a learner\u0026rsquo;s brain (McTighe \u0026amp; Willis, 2019).\nThe following graphic is a selection of learning theories (Millwood, R. 2013)\nAs I reflected on this graphic, I tried to find the connections between theories and concepts I use in my teaching practice. Do I (attempt) to make communities of practice? Absolutely. Do I strive to provide experiential learning opportunities for my students? Absolutely. Do I think that learning is, at its heart, done in the brain of the learner? Yes.\nBut it goes further than any of those theories on their own. As I considered the graphic, I realized I am drawn to radical constructivism. I have not learned about this theory previously, but I look forward to learning more. The basic definition is that knowledge is created in the learner\u0026rsquo;s mind. I spend my time with students aged 7-12. I hear the students work through their existing schema, background knowledge, and experiences I have not participated in to make new knowledge. When my explanations have failed, it is invariably a classmate who can guide the struggling learner through their struggle by connecting with the student\u0026rsquo;s existing knowledge. The classmate serving as a guide has an understanding of the world (a mental model, if you will) that more closely aligns with the struggling learners\u0026rsquo; understanding of the world than I have. It\u0026rsquo;s the same reality, but our understandings and interpretations of it differ. Neither is, necessarily, more right than the other.\n","date":"1 February 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1706848252285-how-we-learn/","section":"Posts","summary":"My favorite moments are when a mental light bulb goes off, a smile lights up their face, and something like \u0026ldquo;OH!","title":"How We Learn","type":"posts"},{"content":" Welcome # First, welcome. If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this and you aren\u0026rsquo;t my professor or a classmate, thanks for stopping in. This blog entry is a brief analysis of the article \u0026ldquo;Power/Knowledge for Educational Theory: Stephen Ball and the Reception of Foucault\u0026rdquo; by Chia-Ling Wang.\nClarification # Before moving on, I feel it\u0026rsquo;s important to define the main idea being discussed in both Ball\u0026rsquo;s article and Wang\u0026rsquo;s rebuttal: power/knowledge. The following definition comes from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: power/knowledge is a tool (such as an exam of some kind) that simultaneously provides data about a person and can be used to illicit certain behaviors from them. For example: an exam at school seeks to find out what a student understands about a subject (knowledge) and also is used as a tool to change their behavior (power) by enticing them to study.\nProblems # This article is a highly dense read, which relies heavily on quotes from a variety of philosophers. In fact, this dependence on so many isolated quotes from a wide variety of philosophers is a weakness of this article. The use of quotes causes the arguments being made to lose their cohesiveness. The quotes provide the weight of the philosophers being brought forward, but there is no cohesive argument through the number of quotes provided.\nThe second argument Wang puts forth is titled \u0026ldquo;Foucault is not a thinker of confinement.\u0026rdquo; This argument centers on Deleuze\u0026rsquo;s explanation of the concept of outside and how it applies to the concept of power/knowledge. While this section is clearer, it does not connect back to the discussion about Ball\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of knowledge/power.\nSolutions \u0026amp; Fallacy # For this article, the author would be better served by reducing the volume of quotes and instead taking the time to clearly explain the links between each step of an argument. The appeal to authority represented by the volume of quotes (including 4 block quotes) caused the writing to suffer from a lack of flow, which reduced the effectiveness of the arguments. This also undermined the effectiveness of the writer in creating their own authority, instead relying on the names of those they quoted.\nSecondly, the author presumed a high, high level of knowledge about specific philosophical concepts (power/knowledge) and how Foucault described it over his career. The article set out to discuss how power/knowledge was discussed in educational theory, but the educational theory applications was not clear from the writing.\nDifficulty \u0026amp; General Response # I have a background in debate. I was a Lincoln-Douglas debater in high school, and judged Lincoln-Douglas debate for years. Having that background made this reading a bit easier, but it was by no means an easy article to get through. Secondly, my background prepared me for reading/listening to arguments that utilize a large number of small quotes (some of which are taken out of context) to build cases of various qualities.\nI did make some connections to both Bronfenbrenner\u0026rsquo;s ecological model and Freire\u0026rsquo;s pedagogy of the oppressed as I read this. The combination of Freire and Bronfenbrenner with the power/knowledge model allow us to look at the concept how power/knowledge tools in education - grades, required curricula, standardized testing - impact the practitioners and students as tools of social conditioning, but are the tools of themacro-, exo-, and mesosystems to strengthen social conditioning while prioritizing the prized knowledge of cultural in-groups.\nCitations # Gutting, G., \u0026amp; Oksala, J.
