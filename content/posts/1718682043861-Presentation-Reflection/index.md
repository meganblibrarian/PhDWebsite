I presented my (roughly) 5-minute presentation on the Theory of Planned Development, which included the briefest of brief overviews and an interactive activity. It wasn't a lot of time to go over a dense topic, but luckily it is broken down into fairly basic components. Secondly, I know another student is covering it and I wanted to ensure that we both have sufficient information to present on without overlap. I mostly wanted to explore Lucid as a presentation & activity tool, which provided a great way to do it. Overall, I think the presentation went well, and conveyed the absolute basics of this model and its use. I forgot to mention that Steinmetz et al. (2016) did a meta-analysis involving 123 interventions that validated the effects of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control had statistically significant (albeit small to medium) effect on behavior intention in many circumstances.

What I wasn't able to convey adequately is how often the model is used with other models, either to add in extra components that aren't directly addressed (Mustafa et al., 2021), or because the authors wanted to see how the different models compared (Rejali et al., 2023). People have also expanded it to use in additional domains, like Black et al. (2022) when they added moral disengagement to the framework to create a theory of planned behavior that includes moral decision making as part of the process.  

There are several examples of the theory being used in educational settings. Dunn (2018) found that TPB was able to explain teachers' likeliness to plan on pursuing professional development in math. [This is particularly relevant to how I would like to use this theory later in the semester.](https://meganebarnes.com/posts/1718565259980-theory-of-planned-development/) Another study in schools caught my eye for a different reason. Wang & Tsai (2022) used the theory of planned behavior to analyze educator's likelihood to plan on (and follow through) participating in their school's disaster preparedness activities. I have a side interest in emergency preparedness, and it is interesting to see how a theory used for social science and encouraging general behavioral change can also be used in another field I'm interested in.

Preparing for this blog post, I dove even further into Ajzen's (also spelled Aizen) website and discovered that he has evolved the theory of planned development into the theory of reasoned goal pursuit. This an interesting expansion that combines the theory of planned development and goal systems theory (Ajzen & Kruglanski, 2019). This mini-dive into the author's website highlights a bit of academic myopia I had while researching for the previous presentation: the defaulting to journal searching. I will strive to remember to search for the living websites of active researchers as well as the using library resources & semantic tools (like Research Rabbit). The website was honestly the biggest help in preparing for the talk.
