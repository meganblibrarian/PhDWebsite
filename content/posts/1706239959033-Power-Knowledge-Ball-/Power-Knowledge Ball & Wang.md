\####Welcome

First, welcome. If you're reading this and you aren't my professor or a classmate, thanks for stopping in. This blog entry is a brief analysis of the article "Power/Knowledge for Educational Theory: Stephen Ball and the Reception of Foucault" by Chia-Ling Wang.

\####Clarification

Before moving on, I feel it's important to define the main idea being discussed in both Ball's article and Wang's rebuttal: power/knowledge. The following definition comes from [*Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*: power/knowledge is a tool (such as an exam of some kind) that simultaneously provides data about a person and can be used to illicit certain behaviors from them.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/) For example: an exam at school seeks to find out what a student understands about a subject (knowledge) and also is used as a tool to change their behavior (power) by enticing them to study.

#### Problems

This article is a highly dense read, which relies heavily on quotes from a variety of philosophers. In fact, this dependence on so many isolated quotes from a wide variety of philosophers is a weakness of this article.Â  The use of quotes causes the arguments being made to lose their cohesiveness. The quotes provide the weight of the philosophers being brought forward, but there is no cohesive argument through the number of quotes provided.

The second argument that Wang puts forth is titled "Foucalt is not a thinker of confinement." This argument centers on Deleuze's explanation of the concept of outside and how it applies to the concept of power/knowledge. This section has a more cohesive structure, and effectively shows why
